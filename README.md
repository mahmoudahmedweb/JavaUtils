# JavaUtils
JavaUtils is a collection of utility classes designed to simplify common tasks.
It offers a range of functionalities for mathematical operations, data structures,
and other essential methods.

## Features

### Mathematical utilities for arrays:
- Calculation of standard deviation.
- Finding maximum, minimum, sum, and average values.
- Compute the square root of a non-negative number with high precision using Newton's method.
- Absolute value functions for integers and doubles
### Data Structures:
- **Stack** implementation using linked list.
- **Stack** implementation using resizing array.
- **Queue** implementation using linked list.
- **ArrayList** implementation.
### Search Algorithms:
- **Linear Search** for finding elements in an array with linear complexity.
- **Binary Search** algorithm for finding elements in a sorted array with logarithmic time complexity.
### Sorting Algorithms:
- **BubbleSort**
- **InsertionSort**
- **MergeSort**
- **QuickSort**
- **SelectionSort**

## Purpose
JavaUtils was a personal practice project aimed to enhance my Java programming
skills through hands-on exploration and implementation of algorithms and data structures.
Continuously evolving, this repository will be regularly updated with new functionalities and improvements.
