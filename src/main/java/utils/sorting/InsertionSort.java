 * Implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm for sorting

 * It iterates through the input array and repeatedly removes
 * one element and inserts it into the correct position in
 * the sorted part of the array.
 * The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2) in the worst caseØŒ
 * but it performs efficiently on small arrays.
 * @param <T> the type of elements in the array,
 * must implement the Comparable interface
